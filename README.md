## 🔬 Research Motivation
Despite over 75 women astronauts participating in space missions, there remains a significant lack of research regarding menstrual health and hygiene in space. This study aims to investigate the fluid mechanics of blood removal and disposal in microgravity, addressing critical gaps in our understanding of menstrual product performance in space environments.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Observe droplet dispersion dynamics in microgravity
2. Evaluate tampon performance across different brands
3. Identify performance gaps and limitations
4. Establish baseline data for menstrual hygiene products in space
5. Enhance women's health research in space environments

## 🛠️ Experimental Setup
The experiment utilizes:
- 📸 High-speed camera (Sony A7SIII) with macro lens
- 🔬 Synthetic vaginal models (syngina)
- 🧪 Blood simulant
- 📦 Multiple tampon brands
- 🏗️ Specialized containment system with:
  - White paper background for droplet analysis
  - Clear plastic housing
  - Surgical glove interface
  - Waste management system

## 📊 Methodology
The experiment will be conducted during parabolic flight sequences, with:
- ✅ Pre-flight preparation of saturated tampons
- 🔄 Controlled insertion and removal during microgravity periods
- 📹 High-speed video capture of fluid dynamics
- 📈 Post-flight analysis of droplet formation and dispersion patterns

## 🎓 Expected Outcomes
This research will provide valuable data on:
- 💧 Fluid retention capabilities of different tampon brands in microgravity
- ⚠️ Potential hygiene risks during tampon removal in space
- 💡 Recommendations for future menstrual product design for space applications

## 💰 Funding Sources
- 🏫 UBC Okanagan's Tuum Est Student Initiative Fund
- 🎓 School of Engineering Professional Activity Fund (PAF)
- 🏢 Engineers and Geoscientists British Columbia (EGBC) Student Team Funding

## 🌟 Outreach
The team will engage with various communities through:
1. 👩‍🔬 WISEST Summer Research Program Presentation
2. 👩‍🎓 UBC Okanagan WiSE Seminar
3. 🎨 UBC Geering Up Saturday Club Fluid Dynamics Workshop

## 🌍 Significance
This research addresses a critical gap in space health research while contributing to Canada's space sector by:
- 🚺 Advancing gender-inclusive research in space science
- 🛸 Supporting long-duration space mission planning
- 💪 Developing innovative solutions for astronaut health and safety
